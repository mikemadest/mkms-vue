        Looking at the code ?
          This is a create-vue application

        Why not make a simple HTML page?
          I wanted to showcase and play with Vue 3 but it also helps me to have something easy to update.

        It's made as simple as possible as i'm not a designer.
        I like it commented, clean and with indentation,
        whether in php, javascript or html
